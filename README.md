# Supplement Schedule for Runners

## 🧠 General Notes:
- **Consistency > Timing** for most vitamins (especially B12, D, Omega-3).
- **Hydration & Electrolytes** are key during and after runs.
- **Avoid Overlapping B12** sources on the same day unless needed.
- **Fat-soluble vitamins (like D and Omega-3)** are best taken with meals.
- **Creatine and BCAA** timing matters more than the others.

## 🗓️ Daily Supplement Schedule (with Example Times)

### **🏃‍♂️ Pre-Run (30–60 min before):**
- **GO! REPOR SALT** (1 cap) — for electrolyte support before long or sweaty runs.
- **Creatina Monohidratada** (3–5g) — daily, best absorbed pre- or post-workout.
- **BCAA (5:1:1)** (5–10g) — optional, good for fasted runs or long-duration efforts.

### **🍽️ Breakfast (with food):**
- **Vitamin D 2000 UI** (1 cap) — fat-soluble, take with a meal.
- **Ômega 3 (DHA + EPA + ALA)** (1 cap) — fat-soluble, take with food.
- **Complexo B** (1 cap) — for energy metabolism.
- **Coenzima Q10 100mg** (1 tab) — great for energy and recovery.

### **🚿 Post-Run / Lunch:**
- **GO! CRAMP BLOCK** (1 cap) — for recovery and muscle relaxation.
- **Di-Magnésio Malato 500mg** (1 cap) — magnesium supports muscle and nerve recovery.

### **🍫 Afternoon / Snack:**
- **Metilcobalamina B12 (1000mcg)** (1 tab, sublingual) — max absorption this way.
  > *Use this instead of the B12 drops to avoid overlap.*

### **🌙 Evening / Dinner:**
- **Optional: Another cap of Omega-3** if your intake needs to hit 2000mg+ daily.
- **Di-Magnésio Malato (if sore or hard training day)** — 2nd dose to relax muscles.
- **Creatina (if not taken earlier)** — any time, just stay consistent.

## 🧪 Weekly Rotation Tips:

### To avoid overlap:
- Use **either** B12 sublingual **or** drops on a given day.
  - **Sublingual (1000mcg)**: 4–5x per week
  - **Drops (10mcg)**: Use on off days or skip if using sublingual regularly.

### Optional Periodization:
- **Creatine Loading** (if desired): 5g x 2/day for 5–7 days, then maintain at 3–5g/day.
- **BCAA**: Use primarily on long-run days or fasted runs.

## 💡 Pro Tips:
- **Stay Hydrated** — supplements like creatine and electrolytes require proper hydration.
- **Rest Days**: Still take your baseline (Vit D, Omega-3, Magnesium, CoQ10).
- **Traveling or Racing?** Bring GO! REPOR SALT + CRAMP BLOCK — key for hot conditions.
